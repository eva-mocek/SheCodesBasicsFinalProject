        <strong>Sustainable.</strong>
        <br />
        We live in an age of fast fashion, where clothing is made, worn and
        thrown away in the blink of an eye. At Juniper & Eve, we want to change
        that. All our products are made one by one, with high quality,
        earth-friendly fabrics, in our studio. And our prices reflect the fair
        wages paid to our team.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Inclusive.</strong>
        <br />
        We are committed to providing a safe, welcoming experience for everyone
        across the gender spectrum, and are an LGBTQ+ safe space. No matter who
        you are, you are welcome here. Period.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Creative.</strong>
        <br />
        A fashion designer is, first and foremost, an artist. Clothing can play
        with the way we feel, how we see ourselves, and affects how we connect
        with the world around us. At Juniper & Eve, our designs and colours seek
        to capture the feelings of inner peace, comfort in our own skin, and
        meaningful connection with nature.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Small Business.</strong>
        <br />
        And we mean really small. Currently, outside of the amazing
        photographers, product testers and models we work with, Juniper & Eve is
        a one woman operation. So when we say ‘made by hand’, you know exactly
        which two hands we’re talking about!
